# Project Title

I created this repository so I can following along with a course called Web Design Course: Learn HTML and CSS. This is a refresher course that I will skim through. The idea is for me to get back on the horse and begin my focus on coding.

In the beginning of the year, I began my transition from IT managed service operator to Software/Web Developer. This transition is coming to an end. I am excited to fully focus on development.

I will join my son David Matthew Lopez (https://github.com/noGenkai/HTML-and-CSS) in this course. I will help him along the way so he can get his certifications as I work on my certs as well.
